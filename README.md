# 🪛 Installation

Take note that I've only tested installation on Gecko Linux Barebones on a laptop. Use at your own risk!

```sh
 git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/croakFrog/bspwm_dots.git
 cd bspwm_dots
 ./install.sh
```

# 🐧 Todo

- Add more info on GTK, Cursor Theme, Fonts, Color Scheme

#  CREDITS

My dotfiles are inspired by multiple sources, I would like to thank them once I compile the list. Coming soon.
